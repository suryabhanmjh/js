// destructuring of object
// destructuring is a way to extract values from an object and assign them to variables.
//or we can say destructuring is a way to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

    //Spread operator
    //the spread operator (...) is used to expand or spread an iterable (like an array or object) into its individual elements.
    //It allows you to create a new array or object by combining existing ones or by spreading elements into a new context.

    let obj1 = {name: "Suryabhan", age: 23, city: "Satna"};
    let obj2 = {college: "Sage", dig: "B.tech" };
    let obj3 = {...obj1, ...obj2};  // Spread operator is used to combine two objects into one object
    console.log(obj3);  // {name: "Suryabhan", age: 23, city: "Satna", college: "Sage", dig: "B.tech"}

//array
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for (let i of arr) {
        console.log(i);  // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    }
// multiple by 2

//map method
//The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
    let num= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let newarr=num.map((e) => {
    return e*2  // 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
    })
    console.log(newarr);  // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

    //call back function
    //A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation is completed. (e.g. setTimeout, event listeners)
    //Callbacks are often used in asynchronous programming to handle the result of an operation once it is finished.
 
    //higher order function
    //A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. (.e.g. map, filter, reduce)
    //Higher-order functions allow you to create more abstract and reusable code by treating functions as first-class citizens.


    //filter method
    //The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. (e.g. even numbers)
    let num1= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let newarr1=num1.filter((e) => {
        return e%2==0  // 2, 4
    })
    console.log(newarr1);  // [2, 4]

    // greater than 6
    let num2= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    let newarr2=num2.filter((e) => {
        return e>6  // 7, 8, 9, 10
    })
    console.log(newarr2);  // [7, 8, 9, 10]


    //forEach method
    //The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element. (e.g. print all elements)
    let num3= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    num3.forEach((e) => {
        console.log(e%2==0);  // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    })
    // reduce method
    //The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
